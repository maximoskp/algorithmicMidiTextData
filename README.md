# algorithmicMidiTextData
Algorithmic generation of midi excerpts and corresponding text descriptions that indicate specific concepts that exist within the musical content of the excerpt under description.

It is using a modified version of the code from:

For text paraphrasing, Parrot_Paraphraser could be used, but it is painfully slow:

So paraphrasing happens using different premanufactured phrase templates.
